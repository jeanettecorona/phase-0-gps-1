# Reflection

### What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* I was struggling with knowing which branch to merge, whether to merge feature into master or master into feature. 

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* Always pull from master before making new changes so that you have the latest updated source code -- this is something I have to remember and practice. 


### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* I asked about best practices for commit messages (how specific should it be) and the difference between merging from master to feature branch and vice versa. 


### What still confuses you about Git?
* I would like to learn how to navigate the different commit save points and revert back to old revisions. 


### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* It was great despite not having a partner. Laura went at a good, fast pace. She also introduced me to a new command `git push -u origin <newbranch>`, which points the remote to the newbranch.
